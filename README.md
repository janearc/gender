on identity
---
I am a transgender woman with a genderfluid presentation. This means that sometimes I will appear to be "a woman," and sometimes I present agender, more masculine, more feminine, and so on. This can be confusing. Because of this, it makes sense for most people to use ["they/them"](http://pronoun.is/they) pronouns with me unless they are intimately familiar or have reason to believe they can assess my presentation, which is intricate, carries a lot of signal, and changes continually.

**In short, "if you have to ask which pronoun to use, use they."**

I am willing to have a pronouns discussion with anyone I am already in contact with but I request that they be familiar with the concepts of:
 - [boundaries](http://psychcentral.com/lib/the-importance-of-personal-boundaries/)
 - [enthusiastic ongoing consent](https://medical.mit.edu/community/violence-prevention/consent)
 - [triggers](http://www.nimh.nih.gov/health/topics/post-traumatic-stress-disorder-ptsd/index.shtml)

beforehand and ask that they say, "hey, can we talk about pronouns?" so that I understand what we are discussing. Feel free to reference this document.

I tell people, particularly people I date, that I am a **space robot**. I am slightly less than two-thirds serious (62.5%) when I say this. I have reasons for this that are important to people I am socially familiar with. These reasons are relevant to your interests if you [want to be friends](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gJLIiF15wjQ).

on misgendering
---
I am a person who lives with [PTSD](http://www.ptsd.va.gov/public/PTSD-overview/basics/what-is-ptsd.asp). This is [alarmingly common in the trans community](http://tmt.sagepub.com/content/17/2/56.abstract), and if you misgender me, sometimes it won't bother me and I have the emotional capacity to say "oh, hey, actually, that's the wrong pronoun;" sometimes I will ignore it, sometimes I will run to the nearest door crying. But it is especially important that you do not press the issue by, for example, insisting that you "be able to apologise," or that *you* must be able to address this; doing so re-traumatises me, and makes things *worse* for me, and will cause me to withdraw further, faster, and harder. Let me pull away, collect myself, and I will come back to you when I am able. It may be in an hour, it may be in a day or two, it may even be a couple weeks. It may be a while before I feel "safe" again.

Understand that misgendering happens. I have friends who I myself still misgender (because I still suck at ze/zir pronouns, for example). So I understand that you aren't "intentionally" doing it to me. Making a big deal about it *makes it even worse*. If you fuck up, own it, say sorry (if possible), and move on. But remember, there is a lot of trauma on my end, and please respect that. It's not about your need to apologise or prove you're a good ally. I know you're trying. I know you didn't do it on purpose.
