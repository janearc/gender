on identity
---
I am a transgender woman with a genderfluid presentation. This means that sometimes I will appear to be "a woman," and sometimes I present agender, more masculine, more feminine, and so on. This can be confusing. Because of this, it makes sense for most people to use ["they/them"](http://pronoun.is/they) pronouns with me unless they are intimately familiar or have reason to believe they can assess my presentation, which is intricate, carries a lot of signal, and changes continually.

**In short, "if you have to ask which pronoun to use, use they."**

I am willing to have a pronouns discussion with anyone I am already in contact with but I request that they be familiar with the concepts of:
 - [boundaries](http://psychcentral.com/lib/the-importance-of-personal-boundaries/)
 - [enthusiastic ongoing consent](https://medical.mit.edu/community/violence-prevention/consent)
 - [triggers](http://www.nimh.nih.gov/health/topics/post-traumatic-stress-disorder-ptsd/index.shtml)

beforehand and ask that they say, "hey, can we talk about pronouns?" so that I understand what we are discussing. Feel free to reference this document.

I tell people, particularly people I date, that I am a **space robot**. I am slightly less than two-thirds serious (62.5%) when I say this. I have reasons for this that are important to people I am socially familiar with. These reasons are relevant to your interests if you [want to be friends](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gJLIiF15wjQ).
